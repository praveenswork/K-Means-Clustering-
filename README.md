## K-Means Clustering from Scratch (NumPy)

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using only
NumPy. A 5-dimensional synthetic dataset is generated using scikit-learn's
make_blobs function.

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, followed by
clustering using a custom K-Means implementation. Results are visualized using a
2D projection and evaluated using the Silhouette Score.

The project also includes a comparison with scikit-learn’s optimized KMeans
implementation and a detailed analysis report discussing complexity, challenges,
and performance differences.

This work demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of unsupervised learning
and clustering algorithms.
