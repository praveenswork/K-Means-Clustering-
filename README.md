# K-Means-Clustering-
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy. A synthetic 2D dataset with four clusters is generated, clustered using a custom K-Means implementation, visualized with Matplotlib, and evaluated using the Silhouette Score. Results are compared with scikit-learn’s KMeans.
