Optimal K Selection (Elbow Method)

The Elbow Method was applied by plotting inertia values for K ranging from 1 to 8.
A clear elbow was observed at K = 4, indicating diminishing returns in inertia
reduction beyond this point. Therefore, K = 4 was selected as the optimal number
of clusters.

Final Centroids

The final centroids were computed in 5-dimensional space using the custom
K-Means implementation. Although visualization is limited to 2D projections,
the algorithm operates fully in higher dimensions.

Challenges Faced During Implementation

1. Efficient distance computation in higher dimensions required careful use of
   NumPy broadcasting.
2. Handling empty clusters during centroid updates needed additional checks.
3. Convergence stability was sensitive to random initialization.
4. Visualizing high-dimensional clustering required dimensional projection.

Computational Complexity

Each iteration has a time complexity of O(n × k × d).
Total complexity is O(i × n × k × d), where:
n = samples, k = clusters, d = dimensions, i = iterations.

Comparison with scikit-learn

The scikit-learn implementation converges faster due to k-means++ initialization
and optimized low-level routines. The custom implementation prioritizes clarity
and educational value.
