Elbow Method and Optimal K Selection

The Elbow Method was implemented using the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)
calculated manually in the custom K-Means implementation. The elbow plot showed
a clear inflection point at K = 3, which aligns with the known number of Iris
species. Therefore, K = 3 was selected as the optimal number of clusters.

Iris Dataset Clustering Interpretation

The custom K-Means algorithm was applied to the Iris dataset using all four
features. A 2D visualization was generated using Sepal Length and Sepal Width
for interpretability.

One cluster strongly corresponds to Iris-setosa, indicating good separation.
The remaining two clusters show partial overlap between versicolor and
virginica, which is expected due to feature similarity between these species.

Comparison with Ground Truth Labels

Since K-Means is unsupervised, cluster labels do not directly match species
labels. However, qualitative comparison shows meaningful structure alignment,
especially for Iris-setosa.

Challenges Encountered

- Handling empty clusters during centroid updates
- Determining optimal K without supervised labels
- Visualizing high-dimensional clustering in 2D
- Sensitivity to random centroid initialization
