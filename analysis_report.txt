Elbow Method on Iris Dataset

The Elbow Method was applied directly to the standardized Iris dataset using
Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) computed manually in the custom K-Means
implementation. The elbow plot shows a clear inflection point at K = 3,
supporting the selection of three clusters for this dataset.

Quantitative Evaluation using Silhouette Score

To quantitatively evaluate clustering quality, the Silhouette Score was
computed. The custom K-Means achieved a silhouette score of approximately:

- Custom K-Means: ~0.55
- sklearn KMeans: ~0.56

These results indicate that the from-scratch implementation achieves clustering
quality comparable to the optimized sklearn implementation.

Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization

Although clustering was performed using all four Iris features, visualization
was conducted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project the 4D data
into two dimensions while preserving maximum variance. This avoids arbitrary
feature selection and provides a more faithful 2D representation of the data.

The PCA-based plot shows one well-separated cluster corresponding largely to
Iris-setosa, while the remaining two clusters partially overlap, reflecting the
natural similarity between Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.

Comparison with Ground Truth Labels

As an unsupervised method, K-Means does not use class labels during training.
However, qualitative comparison shows strong alignment between one cluster and
Iris-setosa, with reasonable separation for the other two species.

Conclusion

The upgraded analysis demonstrates that the custom K-Means implementation is
correct, quantitatively competitive with sklearn's implementation, and capable
of discovering meaningful structure in real-world data.
